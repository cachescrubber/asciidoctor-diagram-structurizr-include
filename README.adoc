Example structurizr workspace to reproduce an issue with `!include` element of the structurizr dsl.

Validating the workspace using the structurizr-cli:

[source, bash]
----
# structurizr-cli validate -w src/main/asciidoc/system-catalog/dsl/system-landscape/workspace.dsl
----

The cli is able to resolve included files relative to the workspace.dsl file location.

Rendering the workspace with asciidoctor-diagram is unable to resolve included files:
